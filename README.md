**Abstract**: This is a dissertation of Computer Engineering Bachelor Final Thesis, course whose initials are MC030, offered by Institute of Computing UNICAMP in the first semester of 2018. In this paper, a data set of professional football players’ historical in-game statistics from recent years were built through Feature Engineering methodology and then it was applied Machine Learning algorithms in order to characterize players who were nominated to the annually award called Ballon d’Or. That was approached as a classification problem, where the predictor should classify correctly whether the current player, according to his annual performance, will be nominated to the Ballon d’Or award at the end of the year or not. We applied some Machine Learning and Data Mining algorithms like: ZeroR, OneR, Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3), Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The obtained results by each method are discussed and compared between them in order to evaluate how accurate they are according to a football expert’s opinion.
